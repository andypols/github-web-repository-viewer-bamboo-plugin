Designed to work with Bamboo's built-in git (Bamboo version 3.0 or greater) and GitHub repositories.

h2. Bamboo Compatibility

|_. File |_. Bamboo Version |
| github-web-rep-viewer-1.0.0.jar | 3.0                 |
| github-web-rep-viewer-1.0.1.jar | 3.3.2               |

h2. Installation

Copy the github-web-rep-viewer jar to @$BAMBOO_INSTALL_DIR/webapp/WEB-INF/lib@.

h2. Build from source

Define the @bamboo.server.lib@ value in the @build.xml@ so the build has access to the bamboo jars (Bamboo is commercial, so I can't include them the github repository).

Run the @ant all@ task.
